ptp,Clear instructions?,Notice blue schema_C,Notice green schema_IC,Notice red landmarks,Notice yellow random,Strategy?,Did visible ones help or hinder?,Anything else
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,Yes the instructions were clear,I can't remember if it was the blue board but im pretty sure one board did that,No i did not notice that they swapped,No i did not notice that,I could feel that it was different Each time,"I mostly tried to remember roughly where the pictures are according to the cube, if it was close to the left side i would remember left side for that image, if it was at a right angle i would remember right angle. ",I think the visible pictures helped in remembering the items location as you could associate one image to remember with another image near it i.e. Remembering chair is next to Hose for example. Whereas on the last trial you were forced to only remember the general positioning which made it harder for me.,"The images were very small, if its possible to make them bigger that would be better because i got many incorrects by being less than a cm away from the object. "
5f57c4a6dff3f02ce0a8f1f5,Yes they were!,"I cant remember the different boards now, but I know some moved and some didnt","I cant remember the different boards now, but I know some moved and some didnt","I cant remember the different boards now, but I know some moved and some didnt","I cant remember the different boards now, but I know some moved and some didnt",I tried to remember which half of the board they were in and whether they were a square or rectangular from each corner,Hinder - i tried to disregard them when they were there,no
609478fa9e5b4d075246cfaf,"They were clear. Just wasn't taking them in properly, only had around four hours sleeps. Zombified!","Not 100%, but I think so.",The same.,Don't think so.,Think so.,"On the one with one set of pictures fixed their position in my minds eye.

On the others didn't really have a strategy until towards the end when I realised the hidden pictures were in the same position each time and could be worked out by memory. On the next trial they moved though so that strategy couldn't be used.",They helped on the ones where the pictures didn't move. They were of no use when the images moved.,"The boards were far too small. I have a decent size monitor and It was hard to make out what the images were. It made all the rounds, but the one with one set of pictures, almost impossible.

It would have been better if the board had been full screen."
60e43d16eb3536f1618652fb,yes they seemed fine . practice helped the most .,no,no,no,yes,i tried estimating how many squares from the edges,i think the visible pictures didn't play a part in the decisions for me .,none thanks .
5c9a698bd40ce2001423396e,they were clear,yes,yes,no,yes,"for the boards where I knew the visible pictures didnt move, I tried to use them as a reference point.","It depended as sometimes it gave me more of a bearing, whilst if they moved then it confused me.",no
5d776e218a8d1d00166d36a6,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,I tried to imagine a 9 graph with 9 side squares and try and remember where in that square they were.,"They hindered me when moving but helped when they stayed in the same place. It was easier when they stayed in the same place, but it was easy when they all vanished, compared to the trials where the different objects would move around.",Nothing else
604fa685e33606f9a0ee8189,"Yes, I found them very clear - had no issues.",Yes I did think this at the time of doing this session.,Yes!,I didnt notice that it was 2/6 ,Yes i noticed this,"I tried to mentally visualize where the images were once they appeared, or try to remember which visible picture they was next to.","the visible ones that were moving and didnt stay in the same place was a bit distracting, but it made it more fun and challenging","no, very fun experiment thank you!"
6047ae5953a87c02d47fc454,"YEs, they were very clear",I didn't - I think I noticed this in the purple one,Yes,I didn't - I was more focused on getting the hidden ones right,"Yes, I think so","Yes, I was saying their names out load. And depending to their proximity to the center of the board I would scream more or less. And I would move my head if it was right or left.","To be honest, no. I didnÂ´t even look at the visible pics.","During the trials, please make the thing a bit slower. "
5dc983b9902a986ae3ac3edc,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,"If the pictures did not move, then I would try and approximate it to them. If random, I would just have to gauge the rough area.","The pictures were only useful if they remained the same. Otherwise, it would be a hinderance.",No.
615a170c6eca532c6f57e09c,"Yes, although I found it only worked full screen and I don't think I spotted an instruction to tell me to do that?",Yes,Yes,I noticed some moved and others didn't but not the numbers.  Was more interested in their positions to try and locate the hidden obects.,Yes,Tried to visualise a grid.  Nothing in outer row/column and then use that to give a position.  Also remembering where things are relative to the centre.,"Mildly helpful if they were fixed, I think moving ones confused me more.",An indicator of time remaining maybe.
5f919274b5383b00096b0295,yes there were clear,yes I did ,when I realized that I tried to focus only on non-visible ones to memorize them ,when I realized that I tried to focus only on non-visible ones to memorize them ,when I realized that I tried to focus only on non-visible ones to memorize them ,I tried to slit the page 4 blocks and tried to remember which object in which block and exactly what part. I used same structure for all after the first one ,yes It very depends on the board since some of them very difficult so I need to focus only non visible objects not the boad,when I click the frame of the non visible object it says incorrect I guess they were the frame of the images.
